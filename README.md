an useful realtime webserver 

##what is different from `meteor` ?
- work well with the node modules, can use `npm` in package file immediately.
- bind popular 3rd-part tools `mocha` `karma` `chai` `coffeescript`, and can easily append others.
- bind meteor famous packages like `ejson` `deps` `minimongo` `livedata` `mongo-livedata`, these packages are very very useful I think.
- remove meteor ui and meteor template engine `spacebars`, so you can use others like `angularjs`.
- a new webapp package can be as a Middleware and work well with the connect or express.
- a new package manager `XPM` keeping to `Commonjs`.
- async load require packages.
- easily test packages in client side adn server side.

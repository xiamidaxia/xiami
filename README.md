v0.0.2

An useful realtime web framework based from [meteor](https://github.com/meteor/meteor)

##what is different from `meteor` ?
- work well with the node modules, can use `npm` in package file immediately.
- bind popular 3rd-part tools `mocha` `karma` `chai` `coffeescript`, and can easily append others.
- bind meteor famous packages like `ejson` `deps` `minimongo` `livedata` `mongo-livedata`, these packages are very useful I think.
- remove meteor ui and meteor template engine `spacebars`, so you can use others like `angularjs`.
- a new webapp package can be as a Middleware and work well with the connect or express.
- a new package manager [XPM](https://github.com/xiamidaxia/xpm) keeping to `CommonJs`.
- async load require packages in client.
- easily test packages both in client side and server side.
- static files can run through CDN
